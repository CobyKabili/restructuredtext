Sphinx Tutorial

Getting Set Up
**************

Philosophy
----------

`Sphinx`_ is what is called a documentation generator.
This means that it takes a bunch of source files in plain text,
and generates a bunch of other awesome things, mainly HTML.
For our use case you can think of it as a program that takes in plain text
files in `reStructuredText`_ format, and outputs HTML.

::

    reST -> Sphinx -> HTML

So as a user of Sphinx, your main job will be writing these text files.
This means that you should be minimally familiar with `reStructuredText`_ as
a language.
It's similar to Markdown in a lot of ways,
if you are already familiar with Markdown.

Installing Sphinx
-----------------

The first step is installing `Sphinx`_.
Sphinx is a python project,
so it can be installed like any other python library.
Every Operating System should have Python pre-installed,
so you should just have to run::

    sudo easy_install Sphinx

.. note:: Advanced users can install this in a virtualenv if they wish.
    Also, ``pip install Sphinx`` works fine if you have Pip.

Getting Started
---------------

Now you are ready to creating documentation.
Create a directory called ``crawler``.
Inside that directory you should create a ``docs`` directory,
and move into it::
	
	mkdir crawler
	cd crawler
	mkdir docs
	cd docs

Then you can create the Sphinx project skeleton in this directory::

  sphinx-quickstart

accepting all the defaults, calling the project ``Crawler``, and giving it a `1.0` version.
Your file system should now look similar to this::

    crawler/
        docs/
            conf.py
            index.rst
            Makefile

We have a top-level ``docs`` directory in the main project directory.
Inside of this is:

``index.rst``:
    This is the index file for the documentation, or what lives at ``/``.
    It normally contains a *Table of Contents* that will link to all other
    pages of the documentation.

``conf.py``: which allows for customization of Sphinx.
	You won't need to use this too much yet,
	but it's good to be familiar with this file.

``Makefile``: This ships with Sphinx,
    and is the main interface for local development,
    and shouldn't be changed.

``_build``:  The directory that your output files go into.

``_static``: The directory to include all your static files, like images.

``_templates``: Allows you to override Sphinx templates to customze look and feel.

Building docs
-------------

Let's build our docs into HTML to see how it works.
Simply run::

    # Inside top-level docs/ directory.
    make html

This should run Sphinx in your shell, and output HTML.
At the end, it should say something about the documents being ready in
``_build/html``.
You can now open them in your browser by typing::

    open _build/html/index.html

This should display a rendered HTML page that says **Welcome to Crawlerâ€™s documentation!
** at the top.

``make html`` is the main way you will build documentation locally.
It is simply a wrapper around a more complex call to Sphinx.

Documenting a Project
*********************

Now that we have our basic skeleton,
let's document the project.
As you might have guessed from the name,
we'll be documenting a basic web crawler.

For this project,
we'll have the following pages:

* Index Page
* Installation
* Cookbook
* Command Line Options

Let's start with the Installation Instructions.

Installation docs
-----------------

Installation documentation is really important.
Anyone who is coming to the project will need to install it.
For our example,
we are installing a basic Python script,
so it will be pretty easy.

Our RST file will look pretty simple for now::

	============
	Installation
	============

	At the command line::

	    easy_install crawler

	Or, if you have virtualenvwrapper installed::

	    mkvirtualenv crawler
	    pip install crawler

This snippet introduces a couple of simple concepts.
